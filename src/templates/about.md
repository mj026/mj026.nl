Hi, I'm Martijn, a software developer based in Arnhem, NL. I have 20+ years of (web) development experience, mostly with (but not limited to) the programming language [Python](https://www.python.org).

I'm a proponent of Open Source Software and the values associated with it. I highly value privacy and security and care about social and environmental impact. Current AI developments are promising but I'm also guarded regarding consequences and usecase(s): I do not consider it as a solution to everything.

TDD, CI/CD and DevOps are things I like to implement and automate with tools such as [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Gitlab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/) and [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). I sometimes orchestrate full stacks with [Terraform]("https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform") and/or [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/).

I'm also familiar with front-end development including HTML, Javascript (TS), (S)CSS or frameworks like [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

Unix based systems like Linux and MacOS are my preferred OS's. My current favourite Container OS is [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/)</a>: A lean Linux distribution with a small footprint. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is still my favourite editor.
